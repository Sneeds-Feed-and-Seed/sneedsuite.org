				<h2>
					FAQ
				</h2>
				<h3>
					Where does the name come from?
				</h3>
				<p>
					"Sneed" comes from episode 5 of season 11 of The Simpsons, <cite>E-I-E-I-D'oh</cite> (or <cite>E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)</cite>). Sneed (and the sign it appears on, <i>Sneed's Feed and Seed (Formerly Chuck's)</i> is a meme that has become very popular on 4chan (especially amongst the "blue," or "Safe-For-Work," boards). Some reference to "Sneed" is always incorporated into the names of our software.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Is this a serious project?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, this is a serious project. Many people are working on the software and intend to support it in the future.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Is all software you produce open source?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Yes, all software we develop and distribute is open source; feel free to contribute if you would be so generous as to do so.
				</p>
				<h3>
					What projects are you working on (or have completed)?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Currently, the list of projects we are working on are Sneedacity (audio-manipulation tool based off of Audacity), and SIMP (image-manipulation tool based off of GIMP). Hear more about our projects and software by going to the "<a href="projects/index.html">Projects</a>" tab in the navigation bar.
				</p>
				<h3>
					How did you get started? What is /g/?
				</h3>
				<p>
					We started working on our first project, Sneedacity, on the imageboard 4chan's /g/ board, which is the section of the forum dealing with technology (mainly computer science). We decided to fill the niche in the market when we learned that many people were looking for a derivative of Audacity that did not send data to the company that owns the software (a version that did not include "spyware").
